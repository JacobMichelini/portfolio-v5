          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>Worked as a project manager and developer for 50+ projects. Everything from responsive conversions, to creating new site templates for widespread use, to working directly with clients to match a specific vision. Styles ranging all across the board from traditional to modern.</p>

Many features were designed to respond to the user, conveying the theme of interactive media. Fancy 100% CSS product offering displays are also fully adaptable to all screen dimensions. Also did graphics work adapting their logo designs for the site and other promotional material</p>

          <h2>Practical Web Design</h2>
          <p>A tutorial site focused on teaching the student to create a simple traditional page as fast as possible. While actually understanding some real CSS and HTML.</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>After consuming a vast amount of online information regarding HTML and CSS, I found there to be a general void in extremely applicable, no frills instructional material. Most content is either quite exhaustive or so specific as to be unusable to actually create a site. This tutorial is designed to teach very novice student only the most commonly used and needed concepts, in order to get them making usable site frames (in any layout) as fast as possible. Also contains a list of all useful commonly used aesthetic effects, which are obnoxious to find elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Travelling Tricycle Blog</h2>
          <p>A travel photo-blog to document my time in SE Asia. A custom site focused on presenting as many pictures as possible in a responsive overlapping grid arrangement</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>The simple idea here was to create a cool platform to share my adventures in Southeast Asia. I decided that my primary focus would be on the pictures and using all available screen space to display them. Constructed a custom responsive site with a flexible grid system to accomplish this, all on a teeny tiny netbook while backpacking (trackpads, yuck). The finished product also features a picture based main navigation page with some parallax scroll, and a cute little JS/CSS widget that allows you to change the background colors of individual posts.</p>

          <p>A picture heavy architecture portfolio site utilizing some Bootstrap elements. Also handled photo retouching.</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>A redesign of an existing architecture portfolio site to make it more attractive and usable, incorporating the responsive Bootstrap framework. Buttons were made large enough to click on, and photos make up the vast majority of the site in a collage style. Also handled photo retouching for all pictures included. This was among my first full projects. Much has changed since then but its fun to look back on.</p>

Includes a profile and resume material as well as notes and galleries of original artwork, designed to be simple to update.

          <h2>Vague Tech Startup</h2>
          <p>Testpiece made on the reactive bootstrap framework, with content parodying the average SF startup.</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>A practice exercise in creating a site quickly using popular frameworks (Bootstrap), instead of making everything from scratch. After living in the bay area for a year, filling the site with a satirical take on the hundreds of identical startup sites around was a natural fit. But seriously, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/">enough with the carousel already!</a></p>

          <p>A music sharing blog. Constructed to be modular and easy to update, with an easily searchable archive system.</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>An exercise in pre-designing and slicing PSD's into a page. A simple but very functional music sharing site. The layout and code is all modular and allows new posts with a simple url paste, allowing for Youtube or Bandcamp links. The buttons and textures were all created in photoshop to practice brush and layer styles techniques. I also implemented an extremely simple archive system to allow old posts to be easily found or scanned regardless of age, something I found lacking in many similar sites.</p>

          <p>My older portfolio, fully responsive, animated entirely with CSS.</p>
          <p class="expandable-txt"><span>More Details</span><br>The main idea behind this version of the portfolio was sheer simplicity and easy of use. Photo tiles that react to the users mouse save space and only display additional information as requested. Lack of adaptability to new content types and poor performance on mobile devices without hover states led me to redesign. Also, I just wanted to make something new.</p>
