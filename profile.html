      <h2>Hi, I'm Jacob</h2>
      <p>I really enjoy making things, and helping other people make things better. I got fed up with constantly seeing clunky and unintuitive interfaces, and decided to actually put in the work and learn to help fix them. 
      <br><br>
      I love making interesting and creative designs, but my primary focus is always on delivering a product that functions and presents its information as smoothly and simply as possible. I also take pride in my ability to explain the reasons behind design decisions to others. Even very subjective choices should have logic behind them that can be explained if you look deep enough. Unless you are making a tool by yourself and for yourself, communication is always paramount.
      <br><br>
      I've done graphic design for mediums ranging from T-shirts to landing pages for many years now, working for a variety of small and large businessess. I'm fluent in Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop, and I can take a picture or two in a pinch as well. My digital toolkit usually involves HTML/CSS with magic sprinkle of JavaScript to make it all tick. I've worked in a variety of modern frameworks like Wordpress and Bootstrap, but I'm also extremely comfortable jumping off the beaten path and making something totally original.
